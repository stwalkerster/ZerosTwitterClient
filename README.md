Twitter Client for Zero @ HW Student Union
=====================

This is a twitter client designed for (moderated) display of tweets in a tweet wall idea.

Use is simple - drag the display form window to the screen you wish to project on to, then hit display fullscreen on the moderation form. Find tweets, hit "grab tweets" or enable auto-update, and approve or deline the tweets on the left, delete or re-show shown tweets from the right.

(note true moderation cannot happen - tweets will all be on twitter, it's more a selection of what you want to display on the screen. We use it to hide the really nasty stuff.)
